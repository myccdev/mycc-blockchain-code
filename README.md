mycc-blockchain Core is the mycc blockchain implementation and command-line interface.

Getting Started
---------------

We recommend building on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (64-bit) 

**Build Dependencies**:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install autoconf cmake make automake libtool git libboost-all-dev libssl-dev g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev

**Build Script:**

    git clone https://github.com/myccdev/mycc-blockchain-code.git
    cd bitshares-core
    git checkout master # may substitute "master" with current release tag
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .
    make

**Upgrade Script** (prepend to the Build Script above if you built a prior release):

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/myccdev/mycc-blockchain-code.git
    git checkout master
    git remote set-head origin --auto
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive # this command may fail
    git submodule sync --recursive
    git submodule update --init --recursive

**NOTE:** mycc requires a [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) version in the range [1.57 - 1.65.1]. Versions earlier than
1.57 or newer than 1.65.1 are NOT supported. If your system's Boost version is newer, then you will need to manually build
an older version of Boost and specify it to CMake using `DBOOST_ROOT`.

**NOTE:** mycc requires a 64-bit operating system to build, and will not build on a 32-bit OS.

**NOTE:** mycc now supports Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

**NOTE:** mycc now supports OpenSSL 1.1.0

**After Building**, the `witness_node` can be launched with:

    ./programs/witness_node/witness_node

The node will automatically create a data directory including a config file. It may take several hours to fully synchronize
the blockchain. After syncing, you can exit the node using Ctrl+C and setup the command-line wallet by editing
`witness_node_data_dir/config.ini` as follows:

    rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090

**IMPORTANT:** By default the witness node will start in reduced memory mode by using some of the commands detailed in Memory reduction for nodes.
In order to run a full node with all the account history you need to remove `partial-operations` and `max-ops-per-account` from your config file. Please note that currently(2018-10-17) a full node will need more than 160GB of RAM to operate and required memory is growing fast. Consider the following table as minimal requirements before running a node:

| Default | Full | Minimal  | ElasticSearch 
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| 100G HDD, 16G RAM | 200G HDD, 160G RAM | 80G HDD, 4G RAM | 500G SSD, 32G RAM

After starting the witness node again, in a separate terminal you can run:

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet

Set your inital password:

    >>> set_password <PASSWORD>
    >>> unlock <PASSWORD>

To import your initial balance:

    >>> import_balance <ACCOUNT NAME> [<WIF_KEY>] true

If you send private keys over this connection, `rpc-endpoint` should be bound to localhost for security.

Use `help` to see all available wallet commands. Source definition and listing of all commands is available
here.


Using the API
-------------

We provide several different API's.  Each API has its own ID.
When running `witness_node`, initially two API's are available:
API 0 provides read-only access to the database, while API 1 is
used to login and gain access to additional, restricted API's.

Here is an example using `wscat` package from `npm` for websockets:

    $ npm install -g wscat
    $ wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:8090
    > {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[0,"get_accounts",[["1.2.0"]]]}
    < {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_witness":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

We can do the same thing using an HTTP client such as `curl` for API's which do not require login or other session state:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "call", "params": [0, "get_accounts", [["1.2.0"]]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc
    {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_witness":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

API 0 is accessible using regular JSON-RPC:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "get_accounts", "params": [["1.2.0"]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc

Accessing restricted API's
--------------------------

You can restrict API's to particular users by specifying an `api-access` file in `config.ini` or by using the `--api-access /full/path/to/api-access.json` startup node command.  Here is an example `api-access` file which allows
user `bytemaster` with password `supersecret` to access four different API's, while allowing any other user to access the three public API's
necessary to use the wallet:

    {
       "permission_map" :
       [
          [
             "bytemaster",
             {
                "password_hash_b64" : "9e9GF7ooXVb9k4BoSfNIPTelXeGOZ5DrgOYMj94elaY=",
                "password_salt_b64" : "INDdM6iCi/8=",
                "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api", "network_node_api"]
             }
          ],
          [
             "*",
             {
                "password_hash_b64" : "*",
                "password_salt_b64" : "*",
                "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api"]
             }
          ]
       ]
    }

Passwords are stored in `base64` as salted `sha256` hashes.  A simple Python script, `saltpass.py` is avaliable to obtain hash and salt values from a password.
A single asterisk `"*"` may be specified as username or password hash to accept any value.

With the above configuration, here is an example of how to call `add_node` from the `network_node` API:

    {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[1,"login",["bytemaster", "supersecret"]]}
    {"id":2, "method":"call", "params":[1,"network_node",[]]}
    {"id":3, "method":"call", "params":[2,"add_node",["127.0.0.1:9090"]]}

Note, the call to `network_node` is necessary to obtain the correct API identifier for the network API.  It is not guaranteed that the network API identifier will always be `2`.

Since the `network_node` API requires login, it is only accessible over the websocket RPC.  Our `doxygen` documentation contains the most up-to-date information
